  <br />

  <h1 align="center"><em><strong>Show Performance, Spark Imagination.</strong></em></h1>

  <h3 align="center">It helps users quickly understand, explore, and prototype ideas by showcasing the platform’s performance and capabilities—inspiring innovation through hands-on experience.</h3>

> [!NOTE]
> iQ-Studio is suitable for a range of products developed based on the [Innodisk Qualcomm Dragonwing SoC](https://www.innodisk.com/en/news/innodisk-unveils-ai-on-dragonwing-computing-series).


# Core Software Stack & Architecture

iQ-Studio is built upon a robust edge AI software stack, bridging the gap between hardware and high-level applications:

<br />
<div align="center"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="./docs/fig/ai_on_dragonwing_sw_stack.png"></div>
<br />

- **Hardware & Firmware**: [Qualcomm Dragonwing QCS9075 SoC](https://www.innodisk.com/en/products/computing/qualcomm-solution/exmp-q911) and low-level firmware.
- **Kernel Space**: Powered by [Qualcomm Linux](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qualcomm-linux), integrated with our custom Inno DTB/drivers and Yocto environments. 
- **User Space**: Seamlessly supports 3rd-party LLM SDKs, device management ([iCAP](https://www.innodisk.com/en/products/software-icap)), and inno AVL. At the very top sits the **[iQS-App layer](./README.md#explore-documentation--resources)** (VLM, Streampipe, YOLO, OGenie).

### Qualcomm Linux (QLI) Version Mapping

Our architecture evolves alongside the [Qualcomm Linux Roadmap](https://www.qualcomm.com/developer/software/qualcomm-linux), ensuring alignment with the latest kernel and Yocto Project releases:

| Linux Kernel | Yocto Project | Qualcomm Linux (QLI) Release |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6.6 LTS** | 4.0 Kirkstone | QLI 1.x |
| **6.6 LTS** | 5.0 Scarthgap | QLI 1.x |
| **6.18 LTS** | Wrynose (Master) | QLI 2.x |

<br />
<div align="center"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="./docs/fig/qcl_roadmap.png"></div>
<br />

We ensure a continuous and stable pipeline—from upstream Linux/Yocto projects down to the optimized downstream drivers—unlocking peak performance for edge AI workloads.

<br />
<div align="center"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="./docs/fig/sw_development_pipeline.png"></div>
<br />  

We also provide integrated and supplied [Ubuntu images](https://ubuntu.com/download/qualcomm-iot#evaluation-kit) for development.

> Note: If you want to run Ubuntu and make sure all IO functions work correctly, please contact us to obtain a validated image. The official Ubuntu image from Qualcomm can boot on the platform, but it does not guarantee that all IO functions will work correctly on our platform.

# How to Deploy

Before getting started, please refer to the [Starting Guides](./tutorials/starting-guides/) to boot up your platform. As with the Q911 series, please refer to the [EXMP-Q911 Starting Guide](./tutorials/starting-guides/q911/README.md).

iQ Studio enables users to run applications quickly. It supports both online and offline modes, ensuring that applications can run even without internet access. Currently, we provide two types of application packages—docker images and IPK packages—that can be executed with IQ Studio.

If you are using online mode (with internet access), you only need to install the iQ studio github repository on the platform and run our applications by following the tutorial commands. For usage instructions, please refer to the [Quick Start guide](./README.md#quick-start).

  <br />
  <div align="center"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="./docs/fig/iqs-online-flow.svg"></div>
  <br />

If you must use offline mode (without internet access), you need to first transfer the required packages and the iQ studio github repository to the platform before you can run the applications in an offline environment. For usage instructions, please refer to the [how to install offline package](./docs/how-to-install-offline-package-using-iqs-launcher.md).

  <br />
  <div align="center"><img width="80%" height="80%" src="./docs/fig/iqs-offline-flow.svg"></div>
  <br />

We verify the BSP version on the platform to ensure that applications run correctly. This check is automatically handled by `iqs-launcher`. However, it is important to confirm that the BSP version on your system matches the one specified in the tutorial before running any application.

## Quick Start

### Install iQ Studio

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InnoIPA/iQ-Studio.git
cd iQ-Studio
./install.sh
```
> Note: If you are using Ubuntu, please log in again after installation.

## How to Use

For example, If you want to run the [iQ-VLM](./tutorials/applications/iqs-vlm/README.md). You only need two command run the interative real-time demo.

Launch the OGenie API server:
```bash
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-ogenie
```
Real-Time Display of VLM Predictions on the Monitor.
```bash
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-vlm-demo
```
This provides a real-time display of VLM predictions, allowing you to quickly verify the inference results.
