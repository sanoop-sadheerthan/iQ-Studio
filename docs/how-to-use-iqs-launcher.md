# How to Use iqs-launcher

`iqs-launcher` is the execution entry point for every application shipped with iQ-Studio. It checks the platform BSP version, locates the matching Docker image or IPK package, and runs the application. It supports both online mode (pull from Docker Hub) and offline mode (load pre-staged files).

This page covers both modes side by side. For a single end-to-end demo command, see the [Quick Start](../README.md#quick-start) in the entry page.

## Introduction

`iqs-launcher` consists of three pieces:

- `iqs-launcher.sh` — the shell entry point installed by `install.sh` into your `PATH`.
- `launcher.py` — the dispatcher that parses CLI flags and routes to a module.
- `mod/` — module-level logic: `mod/autotag.py` handles Docker images, `mod/ipk.py` handles IPK packages, `mod/run.py` executes application scripts, and `mod/utils.py` retrieves the platform BSP version.

The public command surface is:

```bash
iqs-launcher --autotag <app_name>[:<version>]    # Docker image: pull / load / run
iqs-launcher --ipk <package_name>                # IPK package: install
iqs-launcher --other <command>                   # Additional flags forwarded to the application
```

`iqs-launcher` automatically detects the platform BSP version and selects the compatible image or package. You do not need to specify BSP-related flags manually.

## Online Mode

Online mode is the default path. With internet access on the platform, `iqs-launcher --autotag` pulls the matching Docker image directly from Docker Hub.

<br />

Common online-mode commands used in the tutorials:

```bash
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-ogenie
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-vlm-demo
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-streampipe
iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-yolov10n
```

To pin a specific version, append `:<version>` to the autotag value, for example `iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-yolov10n:0.0.3`. To pass extra flags to the underlying application, use `--other`, for example `iqs-launcher --autotag iqs-streampipe --other "-c config.json"`.

## Offline Mode

Use offline mode when the platform has no internet access. You pre-stage the Docker image (`.tar`) or IPK package (`.ipk`) on a host PC, transfer it to the platform, and `iqs-launcher` loads it locally.

### Step 1: Download the Package on a Host PC

> Notice: This step requires internet access on the host PC.

**A. Docker Image (`.tar`)**

1. Install [skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo). On an x86 Ubuntu 24.04 host:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get -y update
    sudo apt-get -y install skopeo
    ```

    For other host systems, refer to the official [skopeo installation guide](https://github.com/containers/skopeo/blob/main/install.md).

2. Use `skopeo copy` to download the image as a `.tar` archive.

    Search Docker Hub for the image you need. Enter `innodiskorg/<application name>` at position 1, then pick the version at position 2.

    ![docker-hub-search](fig/docker-hub-search.png)

    Download the image with the command below.

    Usage:

    ```bash
    skopeo copy \
    docker://docker.io/innodiskorg/<docker image name>:<version>\
    "docker-archive:<docker image name>.tar:innodiskorg/<docker image name>:<version>"
    ```

    Example for `iqs-vlm-demo` version `0.0.1`:

    ```bash
    skopeo copy \
    docker://docker.io/innodiskorg/iqs-vlm-demo:0.0.1 \
    "docker-archive:iqs-vlm-demo.tar:innodiskorg/iqs-vlm-demo:0.0.1"
    ```

    The result is a `.tar` file ready to transfer to the platform.

**B. IPK Package (`.ipk`)**

1. Obtain the `.ipk` file that matches your platform BSP version.
    > Notice: `.ipk` files are currently provided directly by Innodisk.

### Step 2: Transfer the Package to the Platform

1. Prepare a USB flash drive.
2. Copy the `.tar` or `.ipk` to the USB drive, then insert it into the platform.
3. Locate the USB device on the platform:

    ```bash
    # on your Qualcomm platform
    lsblk
    ```

4. Sample output (your hardware layout may differ):

    ```bash
    |-sde53 259:37   0     4K  0 part
    `-sde54 259:38   0     1M  0 part
    sdf       8:80   0   200M  0 disk
    sdg       8:96   0     1G  0 disk
    sdh       8:112  0     1G  0 disk
    sdi       8:128  1  14.5G  0 disk
    `-sdi1    8:129  1  14.5G  0 part <- Your USB device
    ```

5. Create a mount point and mount the USB drive (the example assumes you are in the home directory):

    ```bash
    mkdir workspace/usb/
    mount /dev/sdi1 workspace/usb/
    ```

6. Copy the package into the iQ-Studio binaries directory.

    Docker image:

    ```bash
    cp workspace/usb/<docker image>.tar /path/to/iQ-Studio/binaries/docker-images/
    ```

    IPK:

    ```bash
    cp workspace/usb/<demo>.ipk /path/to/iQ-Studio/binaries/ipk/
    ```

7. Verify the package is in the correct location.

    Docker image must be under `iQ-Studio/binaries/docker-images/`:

    ```text
    iQ-Studio/
    └── binaries/
        └── docker-images/
            └── iqs-vlm-demo.tar  <-- your .tar
    ```

    IPK must be under `iQ-Studio/binaries/ipk/`:

    ```text
    iQ-Studio/
    └── binaries/
        └── ipk/
            └── your-package.ipk  <-- your .ipk
    ```

### Step 3: Launch the Application

Run the same `iqs-launcher` command as in online mode. `iqs-launcher` detects the local `.tar` or `.ipk` and loads it directly without contacting Docker Hub. For application-specific usage, see the relevant page under [Applications](../tutorials/applications/README.md).

## Troubleshooting

- **BSP version mismatch**: `iqs-launcher` aborts with a clear message when the local BSP does not match any compatible package version. Cross-check with the BSP listed in each application's tutorial.
- **`autotag` cannot find an image**: in online mode, verify network access from the platform. In offline mode, confirm the `.tar` is under `binaries/docker-images/` and that the filename matches the autotag value.
- **`ipk` install fails**: confirm the `.ipk` matches the platform BSP version. IPK packages are tied to specific BSP releases.
