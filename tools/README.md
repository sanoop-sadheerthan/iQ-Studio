## 1. Included Files

| File | Purpose | Action Type |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`audit_content.py`** | Validates document compliance (images, quotes, links, tags). | **Analysis/Audit** |
| **`fix_bash_tags.py`** | Automatically fixes missing language tags in code blocks. | **Modification** |
| **`get_headings.py`** | Extracts and displays the heading hierarchy of all Markdown files. | **Overview/Navigation** |
| **`compress_gifs.sh`** | Scans for GIFs >= 20 MB; with `--apply`, re-encodes via `gifski --quality 70`. | **Analysis/Audit + Modification** |

---

## 2. Usage

These scripts are written in Python and should be executed from the project root or the `tools/` directory.

### Audit Your Content
Use this to check for formatting errors across the project.
```bash
python tools/audit_content.py
```

### Auto-Fix Code Blocks
Use this to automatically append `bash` or `python` tags to empty code blocks.
```bash
python tools/fix_bash_tags.py
```

### View Project Hierarchy
Use this to get a quick bird's-eye view of all document structures.
```bash
python tools/get_headings.py
```

### Audit GIF Sizes
Use this to find demo GIFs that are too large and may need compression.
```bash
bash tools/compress_gifs.sh                  # report files >= 20 MB
bash tools/compress_gifs.sh --apply          # also compress them (gifski --quality 70)
bash tools/compress_gifs.sh --apply <path>   # limit scope to a path
```

> Note: `--apply` requires `ffmpeg` and `gifski` in PATH.

## 3. Examples: Input & Output

### `audit_content.py`
*   **Input**: Scans all `.md` files for image pathing, note syntax, and link types.
*   **Output**: A checklist of compliance issues or a success message.
    *   **Success Output**: `No issues found! Perfect compliance.`
    *   **Failure Output**:
        ```text
        ### tutorials/starting-guides/README.md
        - [ ] Image not in fig/ or img/ directory: ./logo.png
        - [ ] Line 42: Note/Warning not properly quoted (missing '>').
        ```

### `fix_bash_tags.py`
*   **Input**: Markdown files with untagged code blocks (e.g., ` ``` ` followed immediately by a command).
*   **Output**: **In-place modification** of the files.
    *   **Example Input**: An unlabeled command fence around `git clone ...`.
    *   **Example Output**: The fence is rewritten with a `bash` language label.

### `get_headings.py`
*   **Input**: All Markdown files in the repository.
*   **Output**: A tree-like structure of headings printed to the terminal.
    *   **Example Output**:
        ```text
        FILE: README.md
          # iQ Studio
          ## Core Software Stack & Architecture
          ## How to Deploy
        ```
